## 👤 Patient Web Application

The Patient Application is an AI-powered healthcare triage system designed to guide users from symptom input to hospital queue registration intelligently.

It allows patients to:

- Detect their location automatically or manually  
- Fetch nearby hospitals using OpenStreetMap (Overpass API)  
- Enter personal and medical details  
- Analyze symptoms using AI-based triage  
- Receive risk classification (Critical / High / Medium / Low)  
- Get hospital recommendations based on specialization and distance  
- Generate a smart priority token  
- Track their live queue position in real time  

The system prioritizes patients using medical risk-based sorting:

Critical > High > Medium > Low  
FIFO within same priority  

This ensures emergency cases are handled first while maintaining fairness.
